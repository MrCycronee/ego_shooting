ESX First Person Shooter Camera
A simple script for the ESX Framework that recreates the classic GTA 5 first-person shooter camera perspective. As soon as a player draws a weapon, the camera automatically switches to third-person view. As soon as the weapon is sheathed, the camera returns to the normal third-person view.
